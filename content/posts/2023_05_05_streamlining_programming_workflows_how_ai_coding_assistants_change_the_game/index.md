Lately, there have been concerns regarding the use of coding assistants such as GitHub Copilot. It’s interesting to examine how tools like ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, and similar LLMs-based solutions can help developers and software engineers boost their productivity. Setting privacy concerns aside, it is fascinating to consider how these tools transform the coding process. How much time do we truly spend on coding and how much on understanding the problem? Does the improvement justify adding this to every developer’s tool belt? I would argue that coding is not limited to any specific programming language or the act of writing code itself. Instead, it involves developing a computational thinking mindset that improves problem-solving skills, logical solutions, and critical thinking. AI-powered neural networks amplify these attributes, making them valuable additions to the programming process.
